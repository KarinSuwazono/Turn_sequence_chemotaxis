# Turn_sequence_chemotaxis

This repository contains the data and code used to generate the figures for the paper.

## Data

All necessary data files for reproducing the figures are located in the `Data` directory.
(Large data files within this directory are managed using **Git Large File Storage (LFS)**.)

## Code

The primary code file for generating the figures is:

-   `All_codes_for_figures_250425.ipynb`

This Jupyter Notebook contains all the necessary code to reproduce the figures presented in the paper.


## Running the Code

The `All_codes_for_figures_250425.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook can be readily executed using Google Colaboratory, a free online Jupyter Notebook environment that requires no setup.

1.  **Open in Colaboratory:** Click on the following badge to open the notebook directly in Google Colaboratory:

2.  **Execute Cells:** Simply execute all the cells in the notebook, and the necessary data will be automatically loaded, and all the figures will be generated.

3.  **Output:**
    **The generated figures will be saved in the `/content/Figures/` directory within the Colaboratory environment.**
